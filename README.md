You'll need to install the parse library with `pip install parse`

I've included a docstring, a credit to myself, and the sample input from the assignment's example in the form of a txt file.

I would recommend being open about the use of the function so you don't get hit with a plagarism accusation, you're welcome to link this repo if you want.
